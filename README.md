TOP Foundation's Calculator

Instructions:
Enter numbers either clicking the buttons or using the numbers on the keyboard.
You'll be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide integers and decimals alike.
Have fun using it, but remember to click outside of the buttons after using them if you plan to continue using the keyboard ;)
